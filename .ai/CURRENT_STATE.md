# CURRENT_STATE.md — last-known-good snapshot

_Update this when the working state of the repo meaningfully changes. Keep it short and true._

## What works (baseline)

- CRM + API live on Railway. Repo-local docs describe a single Express + Socket.io + node-cron
  process (`DISABLE_BACKGROUND_JOBS=true` for API-only mode); production may run this split
  across separate `web` + `worker` Railway services if configured that way in the Railway UI —
  **verify actual topology before changing deployment/worker assumptions**, don't assume two services.
- D2C landing on Vercel (`ecom.growthescalators.com`).
- `npm run build` and `npm test` pass on `main`.

## In progress

- **Wizmatch Intelligence Command Center local build**: read-only Phase 1 operating layer over
  existing Wizmatch data. It adds deterministic Contact Intelligence, client discovery scoring,
  candidate intelligence scoring, requirement priority, module health, and a unified command queue.
  No schema, migrations, paid enrichment, sending, worker/cron, package, or deployment changes.

## Recently landed (context)

- Wizmatch Requirement Sheets + India-relevance foundation (region-aware scoring/matching,
  branded requirement PDFs, candidate ingest endpoint, Naukri job-signal scraper rewrite).
- Wizmatch placements wired into the CRM deals/pipeline layer.

## Known issues / watch-outs

- `contacts` shares column names (`tenant_id`, `status`, `source`, `score`) with several
  Wizmatch tables → JOIN queries must alias filter columns or Postgres throws 42702.
- If the worker runs as a separate Railway service, it serves only a health probe, not the API →
  worker crons must call `WIZMATCH_API_BASE_URL` (public `web` URL), not `localhost`.
- Local demo route `/wizmatch/command-center-demo` works without DB/login. The authenticated
  `/wizmatch/command-center` route needs a healthy local API/database and CRM auth token.

## How to rebuild context fast

`git branch --show-current` + `git status --short` → `git fetch origin` (pull `main` only if
intentionally on it with a clean tree) → read `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` → `npm run ai:brief` → read `AGENTS.md`.
