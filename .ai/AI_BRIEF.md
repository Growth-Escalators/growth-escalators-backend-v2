This is a machine-generated snapshot of local repo state. It exists so any AI agent or fresh
chat can rebuild context from the repo alone. For durable guidance read `AGENTS.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, and the `.ai/` files — this brief only reflects the moment it was run.

## Current task

**Wizmatch Staffing Operating System — Phase 0 trust branch in progress as of 2026-07-13. Worktree:
`../v2-wizmatch-phase0-trust`; branch: `codex/wizmatch-phase0-trust`. Nothing pushed, deployed,
sent, spent, migrated, or written to production.**

Canonical product contract:
[`docs/prd/004-wizmatch-staffing-operating-system.md`](../docs/prd/004-wizmatch-staffing-operating-system.md).

Claude Code entry point:
[`docs/wizmatch/README.md`](../docs/wizmatch/README.md) →
[`WIZMATCH_STAFFING_OS_CLAUDE_CODE_KICKOFF.md`](../docs/wizmatch/WIZMATCH_STAFFING_OS_CLAUDE_CODE_KICKOFF.md).
Human-owned decisions live in
[`WIZMATCH_STAFFING_OS_OWNER_INPUTS.md`](../docs/wizmatch/WIZMATCH_STAFFING_OS_OWNER_INPUTS.md)
and must not be invented by an agent.

The target chain is: company → named hiring contact → confirmed requirement → candidate match →
recruiter shortlist → consent/RTR → submission → interview → offer → joining/placement → invoice,
revenue, and margin. The PRD also preserves future concepts without putting them into the MVP.

Current remediation status is canonical in
[`WIZMATCH_STAFFING_OS_DEFECT_REGISTER.md`](../docs/wizmatch/WIZMATCH_STAFFING_OS_DEFECT_REGISTER.md).

**Current verified Phase 0 slice:** D-1–D-5, D-7, D-9–D-12, D-14, D-19–D-21,
D-26–D-30 are locally verified. D-6, D-8, D-16, D-18, D-23 and D-31 are partially complete or
need one remaining verification/design slice. D-13/D-15 and the staffing domain spine remain behind
Gate A. See the defect register for the exact evidence and next action for every item.

**Implemented locally in the current Phase 0 candidate bundle:**

- **D-1:** the canonical Contact Intelligence page now preserves review/manual-add/CRM-link/Pipeline
  workflows while adding read-only discovery preview, explicit cost acknowledgement, confirmed
  manual discovery, and honest authenticated error/Retry behavior. No provider was called and no
  provider/env/budget setting changed.
- **D-2:** requirement parsing uses canonical `apiFetch(FormData)`. Focused tests prove Wizmatch
  token selection, browser multipart handling, and tenant-specific 401 session cleanup. Validation
  and real parse failures have distinct inline feedback; Retry appears only for request failures.
- **D-9/D-10/D-11:** CRM-linked hiring contacts receive Client Lead/company/provenance classification
  on both create and dedup paths; shared Contacts search matches full name and tenant-scoped channel
  values; disabled outcome cards no longer consume the Review Workbench action queue.
- **D-12, D-14, D-20, D-21, D-23:** truthful Contact Intelligence handoff copy, useful
  Requirement Priority empty state, accurate Open Tasks helper, canonical dashboard work order, and
  plain-language CRM-link results.
- **D-3/D-4/D-5/D-7:** manual signals use deterministic scoring; ATS ingestion accepts explicit
  IT-role evidence only; company vocabulary is separate from role fit; SAP ABAP/FICO, Java and
  JavaScript plus known false-positive fixtures pass; hot/warm/watch are all attainable.
- **D-6/D-8/D-19:** AI analysis is bounded to 40 KB/1,500 tokens/20 seconds with safe failure
  details; four primary queue endpoints return true database totals plus returned counts; readiness
  separates schema health from usable-funnel health. Workbench total counting is still open.
- **D-26–D-31:** authenticated outages never substitute demo records or enable dependent actions;
  Pipeline has Retry/finally behavior; demo routes are development-only; the server requires a
  current admin build; login preserves Wizmatch/return path; query-string tabs reset boundaries.
- Local Playwright coverage uses an isolated port 5184 clean-branch Vite server: **8/8 passed**.
- Full local verification: `npm run build`, `npm run admin:build`, `npm test` (**38 files / 316
  tests**), Playwright **8/8**, production-bundle demo-route absence, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Persistent context was hardened: canonical defect register, corrected dataflow/product brief,
  proposed ADR-004 + Phase 1 plan, improved Claude kickoff, and current-tree credential redaction.

**Security approval required:** a plaintext login credential existed in committed history and four
tracked files. The current working tree redacts/removes it and the onboarding script now requires
secure env injection. The live credential has **not** been rotated and Git history has **not** been
rewritten. Rotation is the essential containment step but requires explicit production-mutation
approval; history remediation is a separate coordinated decision.

**Phase 1 approval required:** ADR-004 proposes the company-contact, requirement-contact,
assignment, activity, task-link, skill/match, and delivery spine needed for Person A→SAP and
Person B→Java. Do not edit schema/migrations until the owner records the approval in
`WIZMATCH_STAFFING_OS_OWNER_INPUTS.md`.

**Exact next safe code slice:** finish D-8 with an exact server-side executable-workbench count
contract, then add the mocked AI timeout/rejection and query-tab recovery tests for D-6/D-31.
D-13/D-15 and the core staffing relationship model require the explicit Gate A approval below.
