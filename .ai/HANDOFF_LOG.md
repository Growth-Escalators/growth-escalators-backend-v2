## 2026-07-06 — Contact Intelligence Phase 1 architecture ADR — Codex — READY FOR REVIEW

**What was done**
- Added `docs/decisions/ADR-002-contact-intelligence-phase1-architecture.md`.
- ADR-002 proposes the smallest safe Phase 1 implementation shape: a pure deterministic
  TypeScript service plus unit tests, with no database writes, schema changes, API routes,
  admin/client UI, worker/cron changes, provider integrations, outreach sending, package changes,
  or deployment config changes.
- The ADR keeps paid discovery disabled (`maxPaidDiscoveryPerCompany = 0`), caps visible contact
  candidates at 3, and requires explainable scoring outputs.

**Files created:** `docs/decisions/ADR-002-contact-intelligence-phase1-architecture.md`.
**Files modified:** `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md`, `.ai/HANDOFF_LOG.md`, `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` (regenerated).

**Not changed by this task:** no `src/`, `admin/`, `client/`, `src/db/`, API routes, schema,
migrations, Railway/Vercel config, production logic, `package.json`, or `package-lock.json`.

**Verify:** `PATH="../v2/node_modules/.bin:$PATH" npm run ai:brief` should pass. Review ADR-002
before authorizing the first code PR.
**Next:** If ADR-002 is accepted, implement only `src/services/wizmatch/contactIntelligenceService.ts`
and its unit tests in a later PR.

## 2026-07-06 — Wizmatch Contact Intelligence Phase 1 plan — Codex — READY FOR REVIEW

**What was done**
- Created a docs-only Phase 1 implementation plan for Wizmatch Contact Intelligence.
- The plan covers deterministic company qualification, zero-paid-enrichment rules, internal CRM
  reuse, manual review workflow, exact scoring components/weights, exact status transitions,
  proposed service functions, proposed tests, likely later file touchpoints, risks/guardrails,
  Codex-safe work while Claude is unavailable, and Claude-gated work.
- After the Contact Intelligence PRD branch landed on `main`, this branch was rebased onto
  `origin/main` and the `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` / `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` conflicts were resolved.

**Files created:** `docs/prd/001-contact-intelligence-phase1-plan.md`.
**Files modified:** `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md`, `.ai/HANDOFF_LOG.md`, `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` (regenerated).

**Not changed by this task:** no `src/`, `admin/`, `client/`, `src/db/`, API routes, schema,
migrations, Railway/Vercel config, production logic, `package.json`, or `package-lock.json`.

**Verify:** `PATH="../v2/node_modules/.bin:$PATH" npm run ai:brief` should pass. Review the plan
against the hardened PRD before any implementation work.
**Next:** human/Claude review; schema, migrations, paid enrichment, API, UI, worker/cron, and
outreach changes must wait for explicit approval.

## 2026-07-06 — Step 1: AI collaboration layer setup — Claude — READY FOR CODEX REVIEW

**What was done**
- Added `AGENTS.md` (universal agent instructions) and made `CLAUDE.md` import it via `@AGENTS.md`
  plus a Claude-specific responsibilities section.
- Created the `.ai/` context layer: `AI_BRIEF.md` (auto-generated), `CURRENT_TASK.md`,
  `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `HANDOFF_LOG.md`, `TOOL_ROLES.md`, `REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Created `docs/prd/`, `docs/decisions/`, `docs/reviews/` (each with `.gitkeep`).
- Added `scripts/generate-ai-brief.ts` and the `ai:brief` npm script (local-repo-only, no network).

**Files created:** `AGENTS.md`, `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md`, `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md`, `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`,
`.ai/HANDOFF_LOG.md`, `.ai/TOOL_ROLES.md`, `.ai/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`,
`docs/prd/.gitkeep`, `docs/decisions/.gitkeep`, `docs/reviews/.gitkeep`, `scripts/generate-ai-brief.ts`.
**Files modified:** `CLAUDE.md` (added import + section, prior content intact), `package.json` (added `ai:brief` script).

**Not changed by this task:** no `src/`, `admin/`, `client/`, `src/db/`, `.github/`, `railway.json`,
`Procfile`, or Vercel config. No DB schema, API route, frontend UI, or business logic touched.
(Note: `src/db/migrations/meta/_journal.json` + `0020_snapshot.json` show as dirty in the tree, but
those are pre-existing uncommitted artifacts from the 2026-07-05 Wizmatch `db:generate`, unrelated to Step 1.)

**Verify:** `npm run ai:brief` regenerates `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` successfully (exit 0).
**Next:** Codex review against `.ai/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`; then adopt the role loop in `.ai/TOOL_ROLES.md`.

## 2026-07-06 — Step 2/3: collaboration-protocol fixes from Codex review — Claude — READY FOR CODEX RE-REVIEW

**What was done**
Codex reviewed commit `d0ab81c` and flagged the collaboration protocol itself (not production
code) as unsafe in a few places: an unconditional `git pull origin main` startup instruction,
no explicit dirty-worktree protection, an unqualified "commit and push after each unit" default,
an overstated Railway two-service claim, and an `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` "Current task" section that
only echoed the file's own H1 title instead of the actual task content. All five were fixed:

1. `AGENTS.md` — replaced the unconditional `git pull origin main` step with: check
   `git branch --show-current` + `git status --short` first, `git fetch origin` for freshness,
   only pull `main` when intentionally on it with a clean tree, never pull/merge/rebase over
   unrelated dirty files.
2. `AGENTS.md` — added an explicit "Dirty-worktree protection" section: preserve unrelated
   changes, never stage/commit/delete/reformat files outside the task, never run
   `git reset --hard` / `git clean` / `checkout -- .` without explicit instruction, every commit
   scoped to task-relevant files only (staged by path, not `git add -A`).
3. `CLAUDE.md` — removed the unconditional `git pull origin main` session-start line and the
   "commit and push after each coherent unit" default; replaced with: check branch/status first,
   commit only when explicitly asked or task scope calls for it, never push without explicit
   human confirmation, never push to `main` unless explicitly approved — production deploys are
   sensitive. Folded the equivalent commit-discipline bullet into `AGENTS.md`'s working agreement
   too (removed the duplicate section that edit briefly introduced).
4. `AGENTS.md` and `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` — reworded the Railway deployment claim from an
   assertion of two dedicated services (`web` + `worker`) to a verified/conditional statement:
   repo docs describe a single Express + Socket.io + node-cron process that can run standalone
   (`DISABLE_BACKGROUND_JOBS=true` for API-only mode); production *may* split this across
   separate Railway services if configured in the Railway UI; agents must verify actual topology
   before changing deployment/worker assumptions.
5. `scripts/generate-ai-brief.ts` — replaced `firstHeadingLines()` (which just returned the
   file's first heading, i.e. literally "CURRENT_TASK.md") with `sectionBody()`, which extracts
   the text under the `## Active task` heading in `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` up to the next heading.
   `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md`'s "Current task" section now shows the real task summary.

**Files modified:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `scripts/generate-ai-brief.ts`,
`.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` (regenerated).

**Not changed by this task:** no `src/` (other than the pre-existing, unrelated
`src/db/migrations/meta/*` dirt already noted in the Step 1 entry above — still untouched by
this task), `admin/`, `client/`, `src/db/schema.ts`, `.github/`, `railway.json`, `Procfile`,
Vercel config, or any production logic/database schema/UI file.

**Verify:** `npm run ai:brief` ran successfully (exit 0); `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md`'s "Current task"
section now shows the actual active-task summary instead of the file title.
**Next:** Codex re-review; not pushed, not deployed.

## 2026-07-06 — Step 4: Wizmatch Contact Intelligence PRD — Codex — READY FOR REVIEW

**What was done**
- Created the first product planning artifact for the next Wizmatch build:
  `docs/prd/001-contact-intelligence.md`.
- Captured the AI collaboration workflow decision in
  `docs/decisions/ADR-001-ai-collaboration-workflow.md`.
- Saved the Codex review of the AI collaboration setup in
  `docs/reviews/codex-ai-collaboration-review.md`.
- Updated `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` for the Contact Intelligence PRD task.

**Planning decisions captured**
- Wizmatch Contact Intelligence remains internal-only for Growth Escalators.
- Scope is IT/Tech staffing only.
- Priority is India 80% / US 20%.
- Company qualification must happen before contact discovery.
- Paid enrichment is limited to qualified/high-priority companies.
- Manual approval remains required before outreach.
- Data model, API, and UI are proposals only; no schema, route, or UI changes were made.

**Files created:** `docs/prd/001-contact-intelligence.md`,
`docs/decisions/ADR-001-ai-collaboration-workflow.md`,
`docs/reviews/codex-ai-collaboration-review.md`.

**Files modified:** `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md`, `.ai/HANDOFF_LOG.md`, `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` (regenerated).

**Not changed by this task:** no `src/`, `admin/`, `client/`, `src/db/`, API routes, database
schema, migrations, Railway/Vercel config, production logic, `package.json`, or `package-lock.json`.

**Verify:** run `npm run ai:brief` (or `PATH="../v2/node_modules/.bin:$PATH" npm run ai:brief`
in a fresh worktree without `node_modules`) and review the docs/context-only diff.

**Next:** review the PRD, then create a follow-up implementation ADR before any schema/API/UI work.

## 2026-07-06 — Step 5: Contact Intelligence PRD hardening — Codex — READY FOR REVIEW

**What was done**
- Hardened `docs/prd/001-contact-intelligence.md` before any implementation work.
- Replaced the unapproved Hunter fallback with the approved/known provider order:
  Apollo -> Snov -> Reacher/email verification -> website/manual pattern -> Google fallback.
- Made Phase 1 explicitly zero-paid-enrichment: deterministic company qualification, internal CRM
  reuse, and manual review planning only.
- Reduced the MVP data model to `wizmatch_company_intelligence`, `wizmatch_contact_candidates`,
  and `wizmatch_discovery_runs`; moved relationship edges to a future enhancement.
- Added explicit status enums for company intelligence, contact candidates, and discovery runs.
- Added exact MVP cost caps and a Phase 1 MVP Build Boundary for what Codex can safely do while
  Claude is unavailable.

**Files modified:** `docs/prd/001-contact-intelligence.md`, `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md`,
`.ai/HANDOFF_LOG.md`, `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` (regenerated).

**Not changed by this task:** no `src/`, `admin/`, `client/`, `src/db/`, API routes, database
schema, migrations, Railway/Vercel config, production logic, `package.json`, or `package-lock.json`.

**Verify:** `PATH="../v2/node_modules/.bin:$PATH" npm run ai:brief` and review the docs/context-only
diff.

**Next:** review the hardened PRD; create an implementation ADR before schema/API/UI/worker or paid
enrichment work.

## 2026-07-06 — Step 8: Wizmatch Intelligence Command Center local build — Codex — LOCALHOST READY

**What was done**
- Built a broad read-only Phase 1 Wizmatch operating layer for local review.
- Added deterministic Command Center scoring for:
  - Client Discovery / Company Signals.
  - Contact Intelligence.
  - Candidate Intelligence.
  - Requirement Intake / fill priority.
  - Module health and manual-review command queue.
- Added a read-only `/api/wizmatch/command-center` endpoint that aggregates existing Wizmatch
  tables only.
- Added an admin Command Center page plus demo route:
  `/wizmatch/command-center-demo`.
- Preserved Phase 1 guardrails: no schema changes, no migrations, no paid enrichment, no
  auto-sending, no worker/cron changes, no package/deployment changes.

**Files changed**
- `src/services/wizmatchContactIntelligence.ts`
- `src/services/wizmatchCommandCenter.ts`
- `src/routes/wizmatch.ts`
- `src/__tests__/contactIntelligence.test.ts`
- `src/__tests__/wizmatchCommandCenter.test.ts`
- `admin/src/App.jsx`
- `admin/src/components/navEntries.js`

- `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md`
- `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `.ai/HANDOFF_LOG.md`
- `.ai/AI_BRIEF.md` regenerated

**Verification**
- `npx vitest --run src/__tests__/contactIntelligence.test.ts src/__tests__/wizmatchCommandCenter.test.ts`
  passed: 2 files, 9 tests.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm test` passed: 13 files, 177 tests.
- `npm run build` in `admin/` passed.
- `curl -I http://localhost:5174/wizmatch/command-center-demo` returned HTTP 200.

**Not changed**
- No `src/db/schema.ts`, migrations, Railway/Vercel config, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`,
  paid provider integration, worker/cron automation, or outreach send behavior changed.

**Next**
- Review localhost demo at `http://localhost:5174/wizmatch/command-center-demo`.
- If accepted, decide whether to push this local branch. Persistence/schema-backed approval
  workflow should be planned separately before any migration.
