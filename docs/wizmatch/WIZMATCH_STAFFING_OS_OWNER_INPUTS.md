# Wizmatch Staffing OS — Owner Inputs

- **Status:** Owner-maintained template; incomplete fields are `TBD`
- **Updated:** 2026-07-13
- **Product contract:** [`../prd/004-wizmatch-staffing-operating-system.md`](../prd/004-wizmatch-staffing-operating-system.md)

This file stores business decisions that cannot be inferred safely from code. Claude or another agent
may propose options, but the human owner decides them. A blank field blocks only work whose behavior
materially depends on that decision.

## Safety and privacy

Do not put any of the following in this file:

- Passwords, tokens, API keys, private keys, database URLs or environment values
- Candidate resumes, personal emails, phone numbers, compensation details or other PII
- Confidential client JDs, contracts, rate cards or production exports
- Production login instructions

Use fictional examples or internal record IDs only when necessary. Keep sensitive operating data in
the approved CRM, password manager or secure document system.

Planning numbers are not guarantees. Calibrate them with 60–90-day cohorts and rolling averages.

## 10. Open architecture/product decisions

Non-obvious approved architecture decisions should be recorded in a numbered ADR under
`docs/decisions/`, then linked here.

## 11. Approval log

Use this only as an index to an explicit human decision; do not place secrets or production payloads
here.

| Date | Proposed guarded action | Proposal/ADR | Decision | Approver |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-13 | Implement Phase 1 Gate A locally and generate one additive migration | ADR-004 / PRD 004 Phase 1 | Approved by the user through “Please plan the next phase and get them done as well”; does not approve applying the migration, production writes, push, deployment, sending or paid providers | Product owner (chat instruction) |
| 2026-07-13 | Implement the complete three-phase Staffing OS locally | ADR-004 / PRD 004 / three-phase production plan | Approved through explicit “PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN”; production migrations, production data, environment changes, credential rotation and each push to `main` still require separate approval | Product owner (chat instruction) |
| 2026-07-13 | Perform local release review and prepare progressive rollout | Release-readiness plan | Approved through explicit “PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN”; Railway staging creation, deployment, migrations, production access, flags and push remain separate approval gates | Product owner (chat instruction) |
| 2026-07-13 | Prepare same-day controlled full Gate A–C pilot handoff | Same-day Claude handoff plan | Approved through explicit “PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN”; Claude must pause before every guarded action and Gate C remains blocked until mandatory owner-policy sign-off | Product owner (chat instruction) |
