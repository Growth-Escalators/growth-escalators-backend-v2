# Wizmatch Staffing OS — Owner Inputs

- **Status:** Provisional pilot policy pack approved; named owners and pilot records remain `TBD`
- **Updated:** 2026-07-14
- **Product contract:** [`../prd/004-wizmatch-staffing-operating-system.md`](../prd/004-wizmatch-staffing-operating-system.md)

This file stores business decisions that cannot be inferred safely from code. Claude or another agent
may propose options, but the human owner decides them. A blank field blocks only work whose behavior
materially depends on that decision.

## Safety and privacy

Do not put any of the following in this file:

- Passwords, tokens, API keys, private keys, database URLs or environment values
- Candidate resumes, personal emails, phone numbers, compensation details or other PII
- Confidential client JDs, contracts, rate cards or production exports
- Production login instructions

Use fictional examples or internal record IDs only when necessary. Keep sensitive operating data in
the approved CRM, password manager or secure document system.

## 1. Product owner and decision process

| Decision | Value |
|---|---|
| Product owner | TBD |
| Engineering approver | TBD |
| Operations owner | TBD |
| PRD 004 product direction approved? | Approved for phased local implementation on 2026-07-13 |
| Approved current implementation phase | Controlled full Gate A/B/C pilot is the same-day target; migration apply, production data, environment flags, credential operations, push and deployment remain separately gated |
| Local commit approver | TBD |
| Final schema/migration approver | TBD |
| Final production/deployment approver | TBD |
| Git-history rewrite approver/coordinator | TBD |
| How unresolved decisions are approved | TBD |

## 2. Pilot scope

| Input | Owner decision |
|---|---|
| Pilot start date | 2026-07-13 target, conditional on staging, mandatory policy sign-off and production smoke gates |
| Pilot duration | 60–90 days proposed |
| Pilot companies | Use internal CRM IDs or fictional labels; TBD |
| Number of accepted requirements | 5–10 proposed |
| Pilot skill families | SAP and Java proposed |
| Number of vetted candidates | 20–30 proposed |
| India/US operating priority | India-first SAP and Java pilot approved as implementation default; expansion remains TBD |
| Permanent, contract, or mixed | Mixed permanent and contract support approved for implementation |
| Explicit pilot exclusions | TBD |

## 3. Team roles

Record role ownership without credentials or sensitive contact details.

| Role | Assigned owner/team | Responsibilities confirmed? |
|---|---|---|
| Sales / business development | TBD | TBD |
| Account management | TBD | TBD |
| TA / delivery lead | TBD | TBD |
| Recruiter(s) | TBD | TBD |
| Operations / data quality | TBD | TBD |
| Commercial / finance | TBD | TBD |
| Product/system administration | TBD | TBD |

Approved platform-role mapping for the controlled pilot:

| Existing role | Staffing responsibility |
|---|---|
| `staff` | Recruiter; assigned requirements, evidence, matching decisions, consent and submission drafts |
| `sales` | Account owner; assigned client/requirement relationships |
| `manager_ops` | Operations and data quality |
| `team_lead` | Delivery, submission approval, offers and commercial visibility |
| `admin` | Administration, finance, placements and commercial mutations |
| `viewer` | Excluded from pilot staffing access and mutations |

Production access is restricted to `WIZMATCH_STAFFING_PILOT_USER_IDS` and fails closed when the
roster is absent. `WIZMATCH_STAFFING_PILOT_ALL_USERS=true` is the explicit post-pilot expansion.

## 4. Workflow and stage decisions

| Decision | Owner choice |
|---|---|
| Minimum facts required for a confirmed requirement | TBD |
| Minimum facts required to accept a requirement | TBD |
| Who can accept/reject requirements | Operations, team leads and admins under the pilot role map |
| Who can shortlist candidates | Assigned recruiters, operations, team leads and admins |
| Who approves candidate submissions | Team leads and admins; recruiters prepare drafts only |
| Consent/RTR policy | Exact requirement only; revocable; maximum/default validity 30 days |
| Duplicate-submission handling | TBD |
| Interview feedback ownership | TBD |
| Offer and joining confirmation owner | Team leads/admins manage offers; admins create placements |
| Placement/invoice closure owner | Admin/finance only |

Use PRD 004 state machines as the default proposal. Record only approved deviations here.

## 5. SLA decisions

| Activity | Proposed default | Approved target |
|---|---:|---:|
| Inbound client reply acknowledgement | 2 working hours | 2 working hours |

planning ranges.

| Decision | Owner choice |
|---|---|
| Permanent placement fee policy | Invoice begins on joining, subject to the client contract |
| Replacement/refund reserve policy | TBD |
| Contract bill/pay/margin policy | Bill rate, loaded cost, currency and period required; target gross margin >=20%; admin must record an exception below target |
| Loaded pay-cost definition | Approved all-in cost for the same period as bill rate; client-specific composition stays in the commercial record |
| Currency conversion policy/source | TBD |
| Invoice trigger | Joining for permanent placements under the client contract; contract invoicing follows the approved billing period |
| Collection/DSO owner | TBD |
| Revenue versus gross-margin reporting priority | TBD |

## 7. Permissions and privacy

| Decision | Owner choice |

## 11. Approval log

Use this only as an index to an explicit human decision; do not place secrets or production payloads
here.

| 2026-07-14 | Rotate the previously exposed live Wizmatch-admin credential only | Final Hardening and Production Launch plan | Approved through exact instruction “I approve rotating the previously exposed live credential. Do not perform any other production action.” Completed tenant-scoped one-row rotation; no other production action authorized | Product owner (chat instruction) |
