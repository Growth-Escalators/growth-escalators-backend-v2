## n8n (SEO automation)

Hosted separately on Railway. URL is in `SEO_AUTOMATION_HANDOFF.md` / `docs/seo/automation-handoff.md`.

## Notes

- `consulting.growthescalators.com` is **not in use** — if you see it in CORS config (`src/index.ts`), it can be removed.
- `web-production-311da.up.railway.app` — Railway-generated URL. Cannot confirm current status (not visible in dashboard); treat `api.*` and `crm.*` as canonical and update any hardcoded references to this URL when found.
